<h1 class="heading">An Overview of Models</h1>
<p>
The purpose of Plato is to provide a means of specifying implementable models of mind
based on a causal approach.
A goal of these kinds of model is to capture the changing network of causal interactions that occurs
during the evolution of a mind when described in terms of dispositional processes.
In these kinds of systems the emphasis is on modelling the structures that support the
generation and evolution of phenomenal experiences. 
The experiences themselves are produced from a network of causal
interactions set up by the interplay of a number of sub systems.
This amounts to specifying the structure, interaction and evolution of causal flows.
</p>
<p>
A causal flow refers to a spatio-temporal pattern of causal interactions. 
These patterns are specified by combining various kinds of dissociated instances of
dispositions (did's). 
This is just a verbose way of saying that for causal models of mind the
actual physical means by which a cause brings about an effect
is not important so long as the implementation of the model
results in the required dynamics.
Thus, a did is similar to a neuron, or a transistor, but where the focus
is on how it modulates causal inputs and how it influences its' surroundings.
In addition, the did also has a power of influence (or existence) that is governed
by it's surroundings, and typically competes, via superposition, in a medium that
is concurrently supporting other dids. 
Consequently, a suitably configured neural network would be one kind of support medium
for implementing a causal model. In the current context,
the support medium is a conventional digital computer.
